# Copy the entire desired "define" row from language/localized.chat.php, like in the sample bellow and change the second expression to what you wish to say.
# The change will be reflected to all the available languages!!!
# Don't modify the original language/localized.chat.php, if you want to still be able to apply the ugrades to the next releases in a easy way.
# Whenever you want to personalize your chat language, just copy and paste here from your language file (chat, admin, tutorial) then redefine the lines in this file.

//define("L_WEL_1", "Messages are deleted after %s %s"); //Change the expression "Messages are deleted after" to "We delete messages after" . Comment out this line and see the effect on the login page.
//define("L_WEL_2", "and inactive users after %s %s"); //Change the expression "and inactive users after" to "We also remove inactive users after". Comment out this line and see the effect on the login page
